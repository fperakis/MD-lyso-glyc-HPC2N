# MD-lyso-glyc-HPC2N
An example of runing MD simulations using gromacs at Fysikum HPC. 
https://it.fysik.su.se/hpc/

The simulation includes 10 lysozyme molecules (~200mg/ml) in a 23%mol water/glycerol solution. 
Protein and glycerol molecules are simulated using CHARMM36 and water with TIP4P/2005.
